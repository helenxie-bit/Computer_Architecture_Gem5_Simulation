# Project Description
These assignments in computer architecture aim to utilize gem5 to simulate and analyze the performance of computer systems under various configurations.


# Assignment 1
This assignment mainly focuses on:
- Comparing the performance of a single-cycle CPU and an in-order pipelined CPU.
- Evaluating the effect of changing CPU clock frequency on the overall performance.
- Investigating the impact of memory on the overall performance of the system.


# Assignment 2
This assignment mainly focuses on:
- Learning how to use gem5 to profile programs.
- Evaluating the performance of different configurations of a pipeline.
- Using Amdahlâ€™s law in practice.


# Assignment 3
This assignment mainly focuses on:
- Showing how applications have different behaviors as the microarchitecture changes.
- Investigating the bottleneck in a particular architecture.
- Improving the understanding of out-of-order processor architecture.
